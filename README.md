This is simple website which allows users to register, select there name and publish something.
A user can also see all the posts on the wall by selecting the username from the drop down menu.
You can also go through all the pages as result per page is limited to two.

In order to publish something on the wall user has to register with a unique name which will be stored as author name and all of his 
posts will be saved under that name.


This application uses MongoDB Atlas as database storage and node.js as backend.
React is used for front end.



The parent componend loads an array of all the authors and passes it to the child component using props.


Other than the course material date picker is used from the react library.
